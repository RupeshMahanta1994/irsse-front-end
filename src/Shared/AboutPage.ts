In            1894, two British Signal Engineers, List and Morse, introduced            interlocking in 23 stations between Ghaziabad and Peshawar on the            N.W. Railway.This Indian system of Interlocking was based on            detector locking apparatus for protecting the facing points of            trains moving at high speeds.",

    desc:"  In 1920, Mr. E.W. Baker, Signal Engineer of the then Assam Bengal  Railway (now North Frontier Railway), developed the Double Wire  Signalling, a new form of mechanical signalling, to operate points   and signals using steel wires instead of roddings. This system was  first used on Southern & North Eastern Railways and gained  popularity, becoming essential for providing a signalling system   known as ‘Multiple Aspect Upper Quadrant’ (MAUQ) Signals.",

    title:"cabin interlocking",
    desc:"Large scale Cabin Interlocking was adopted on the Bombay-Delhi route             and completed by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway in 1912. Track             Circuiting, a development from the early 19th Century, and Power            Signalling, developed in the same era to operate points and signals            electrically or electro-pneumatically, were used at busy stations            like Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras. The Block Instrument, known as             the Neale Block Token, was developed by Mr. Neale, an Engineer of             the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, for single-line operations, and             it is still in use in Indian Railways today.",
